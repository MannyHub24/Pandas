# PyCity Schools Analysis

## Overview

As the new Chief Data Scientist for the city's school district, the goal of this project was to analyze standardized test results and school budget data using Python and Pandas. The analysis provides insights into the performance of schools in the district and helps stakeholders make informed decisions about funding and priorities.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook

## Data Sources
- `schools_complete.csv`
- `students_complete.csv`

## Analysis Summary

### District Summary
This section calculates:
- Total number of unique schools
- Total students
- Total budget
- Average math and reading scores
- Percentage of students passing math and reading
- Overall percentage of students passing both math and reading

### School Summary
Each school's performance is analyzed including:
- School type
- Budget per student
- Average test scores
- Percentage of students passing math, reading, and both

### Top and Bottom Performing Schools
Schools are ranked by overall passing percentage to identify the highest and lowest performers.

### Scores by Grade
Math and reading scores are analyzed by grade level across all schools.

### Scores by Spending
School performance is grouped and analyzed by per-student spending ranges.

### Scores by School Size
Schools are categorized by size to determine how size affects performance metrics.

### Scores by School Type
The analysis also compares Charter and District schools.

## Key Findings
- Smaller schools and schools with moderate per-student spending often perform better on average.
- Charter schools consistently show higher average test scores and overall passing percentages than district schools.
